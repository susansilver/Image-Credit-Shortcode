## Explanation of the seven attributes in this shortcode

*URL*

The url of your image. For example for an image on Flickr. 

url="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alesadam/3869366195/?rb=1" 


*WEBSITE*

The name of the website where you grabbed the image from. Most commonly I take mine from Flickr. To use the shortcode
I would use the following.

website="Flickr" 


*TITLE*

The official title of the work by the author.

title="Candle Light" 


*PROFILE*

The url of the author's profile. 

profile="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alesadam/"


*AUTHOR* 

_Check to see how the author would like to be credited_

The first attribute is the author. This refers to the proper name of the person(s) who created the image or took that photo. If you cannot find the 
proper name than it is best to credit the username of the author. Sometimes the author will state how they would prefer to be credited. 

author="Alesa Dam"


*DEED*

The url to the Creative Commons deed or other Licence.

deed="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/"

[URLS for the different Creative Commons licences](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)
 

 *CREDIT*

_For Creative Commons or Copyrights_ 


The credit attribute is where you write the license of the image.


For example this is how I would input a Creative Commons Attribution and Share Alike licensed image using this shortcode. 

credit="CC BY NC SA "   


You could also use the credit for copyrighted material.

For example crediting the screenshot of a website.

credit="&copy; 2014. All Rights Reserved."
